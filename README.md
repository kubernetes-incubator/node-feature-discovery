_**NOTE:** We are gathering evidence in order to graduate from the Kubernetes incubator. If you are a user of the project, please add yourself to [this list](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/node-feature-discovery/wiki/Users) with as much detail as you are comfortable providing (name and email optional)._

## Overview

This software enables node feature discovery for Kubernetes. It detects
hardware features available on each node in a Kubernetes cluster, and advertises
those features using node labels.

This project uses GitHub [milestones](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/node-feature-discovery/milestones) for release planning.

## Command line interface

```
node-feature-discovery.

  Usage:
  node-feature-discovery [--no-publish --sources=<sources> --label-whitelist=<pattern>]
  node-feature-discovery -h | --help
  node-feature-discovery --version

  Options:
  -h --help                   Show this screen.
  --version                   Output version and exit.
  --sources=<sources>         Comma separated list of feature sources.
                              [Default: cpuid,rdt,pstate]
  --no-publish                Do not publish discovered features to the
                              cluster-local Kubernetes API server.
  --label-whitelist=<pattern> Regular expression to filter label names to
                              publish to the Kubernetes API server. [Default: ]
```

## Feature discovery

### Feature sources

The current set of feature sources are the following:

- [CPUID][cpuid] for x86 CPU details
- [Intel Resource Director Technology][intel-rdt]
- [Intel P-State driver][intel-pstate]

### Feature labels

The published node labels encode a few pieces of information:

- A "namespace" (e.g. `node.alpha.kubernetes-incubator.io/nfd`).
- The version of this discovery code that wrote the label, according to
  `git describe --tags --dirty --always`.
- The source for each label (e.g. `cpuid`).
- The name of the discovered feature as it appears in the underlying
  source, (e.g. `AESNI` from cpuid).

_Note: only features that are available on a given node are labeled, so
the only label value published for features is the string `"true"`._

```json
{
  "node.alpha.kubernetes-incubator.io/node-feature-discovery.version": "v0.1.0",
  "node.alpha.kubernetes-incubator.io/nfd-cpuid-<feature-name>": "true",
  "node.alpha.kubernetes-incubator.io/nfd-rdt-<feature-name>": "true",
  "node.alpha.kubernetes-incubator.io/nfd-pstate-<feature-name>": "true"
}
```

The `--sources` flag controls which sources to use for discovery.

_Note: Consecutive runs of node-feature-discovery will update the labels on a
given node. If features are not discovered on a consecutive run, the corresponding
label will be removed. This includes any restrictions placed on the consecutive run,
such as restricting discovered features with the --label-whitelist option._

### Intel Resource Director Technology (RDT) Features

| Feature name   | Description                                                                         |
| :------------: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| RDTMON         | Intel Cache Monitoring Technology (CMT) and Intel Memory Bandwidth Monitoring (MBM)
| RDTL3CA        | Intel L3 Cache Allocation Technology
| RDTL2CA        | Intel L2 Cache Allocation Technology

### CPUID Features (Partial List)

| Feature name   | Description                                                  |
| :------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
| ADX            | Multi-Precision Add-Carry Instruction Extensions (ADX)
| AESNI          | Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) New Instructions (AES-NI)
| AVX            | Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX)
| AVX2           | Advanced Vector Extensions 2 (AVX2)
| BMI1           | Bit Manipulation Instruction Set 1 (BMI)
| BMI2           | Bit Manipulation Instruction Set 2 (BMI2)
| SSE4.1         | Streaming SIMD Extensions 4.1 (SSE4.1)
| SSE4.2         | Streaming SIMD Extensions 4.2 (SSE4.2)
| SGX            | Software Guard Extensions (SGX)

## Getting started
### System requirements

1. Linux (x86_64)
1. [kubectl] [kubectl-setup] (properly set up and configured to work with your
   Kubernetes cluster)
1. [Docker] [docker-down] (only required to build and push docker images)

### Usage

Feature discovery is done as a one-shot job. There is an example script in this
repo that demonstrates how to deploy the job to unlabeled nodes.

```
./label-nodes.sh
```

The discovery script will launch a job on each unlabeled node in the
cluster. When the job runs, it contacts the Kubernetes API server to add labels
to the node to advertise hardware features (initially, from `cpuid`, RDT and p-state).

## Building from source

Download the source code.

```
git clone https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/node-feature-discovery
```

**Build the Docker image:**

```
cd <project-root>
make
```

**NOTE: Our default docker image is hosted in quay.io. To override the 
`QUAY_REGISTRY_USER` use the `-e` option as follows: 
`QUAY_REGISTRY_USER=<my-username> make docker -e`**

Push the Docker Image (optional)

```
docker push <quay-domain-name>/<registry-user>/<image-name>:<version>
```

**Change the job spec to use your custom image (optional):**

To use your published image from the step above instead of the
`quay.io/kubernetes/node-feature-discovery` image, edit line 40 in the file
[node-feature-discovery-job.json.template](node-feature-discovery-job.json.template)
to the new location (`<quay-domain-name>/<registry-user>/<image-name>[:<version>]`).

## Targeting Nodes with Specific Features

Nodes with specific features can be targeted using the `nodeSelector` field. The
following example shows how to target nodes with Intel TurboBoost enabled.

```json
{
    "apiVersion": "v1",
    "kind": "Pod",
    "metadata": {
        "labels": {
            "env": "test"
        },
        "name": "golang-test"
    },
    "spec": {
        "containers": [
            {
                "image": "golang",
                "name": "go1",
            }
        ],
        "nodeSelector": {
                "node.alpha.kubernetes-incubator.io/nfd-pstate-turbo": "true"
        }
    }
}
```
